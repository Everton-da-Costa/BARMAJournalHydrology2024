Description: Provides R code and data to replicate the analysis in Costa, 
    Cribari-Neto, and Scher (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131489>. 
    The paper considers the modeling and forecasting of hydro-environmental 
    time series subject to seasonal fluctuations and prolonged droughts using 
    a class of dynamic beta (BARMA) models. The code addresses the accuracy of 
    hypothesis tests and introduces a new model selection criterion ('the scout score') 
    for selecting the link function of the model.
